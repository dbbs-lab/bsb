.. DBBS Cerebellum Scaffold documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

The Brain Scaffold Builder
==========================

The BSB is a **black box component framework** for multi-paradigm neural modelling: we
provide structure, architecture and organization, while you provide the use-case specific
parts of your model. In our framework, your model is described in a code-free
configuration of **components** with parameters.

For the framework to reliably use components, and make them work together in a complex
workflow, it asks a fixed set of questions per component type: e.g. a connection component
will ask how to connect cells. These contracts of cooperation between you and the
framework are called **interfaces**. The framework executes a transparently
parallelized workflow, and calls your components to fulfill their role.

This way, by *implementing our component interfaces* and declaring them in a
configuration file, most models end up being code-free, well-parametrized, self-contained,
human-readable, multi-scale models!

(PS: If we missed any hyped-up hyphenated adjectives, let us know! |:heart:|)
